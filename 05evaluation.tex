\chap Evaluation

The primary goal of the evaluation part was to collect data from real human drivers in the tasks and environment as close as possible to real-world situations. To reach this goal we established cooperation with the Driving Simulation Research Group based at the Faculty of Transportation Sciences of Czech Technical University in Prague. We were able to use their car simulator and other equipment.
