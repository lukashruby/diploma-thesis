\chap Evaluation

The primary goal of the evaluation part was to collect data from real human drivers in the tasks and environment as close as possible to real-world situations. To reach this goal we established cooperation with the Driving Simulation Research Group based at the Faculty of Transportation Sciences of Czech Technical University in Prague. We were able to use their car simulator and other equipment.

\sec Usability tests

\secc Participants

The usability tests are based on the results from 5 participants from age 24 to 45 (mean age was 28). One participant was female, other four were males. The number of participant was based on recommendation of Jakob Nielsen \cite[nielson5enough].

\secc Used equipment

As mention at the beginning of this chapter, we used equipment provided by the Faculty of Transportation Sciences, namely the 3D car light simulator and Eye Tracker. Logged results were analysed using MATLAB.

\secc Pre-test questionnaire results

Before execution of the usability test, participants were asked to answer some questions about there behaviour while driving. The answers are in the table TABLE.
