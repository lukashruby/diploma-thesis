\sec Assignment completion

\secc Completing the assignment tasks

\seccc Study the current trends in controlling car infotainment systems

Current trends in design and control of infotainment systems are summarized in section \ref[1.types]. Historical evolution and current state are compared. The complexity of currently used devices in in section \ref[1.examples].

\seccc Explore existing mobile applications for in-car use

The most significant producers of mobile applications for in-car use are mentioned in section \ref[2.incarapps]. In the chapter \ref[analysis] is overall described current market, the shipments of mobile devices, and a variety of available mobile operating systems.

\seccc Study communication with car ECU (CAN, OBD, etc.)

Data and communication inside a vehicle is described in section \ref[2.data]. Different types of in-car buses are listed in section \ref[2.buses]. Moreover in section \ref[2.othercomm] is also the analysis of communication with the outer world. 

\seccc Design and implement mobile application for in-car user

This task is the topic of chapter \ref[design] and \ref[implementation]. In chapter \ref[design] the design process in thoroughly described including the general guidelines. In chapter \ref[implementation] the implementation phase is discussed. It contains description of used environment, software tools, third party libraries, and the mobile application implementation.  

\seccc Implement logging server

Process of design and development of the logging server for purposes of storing driving data is described in section \ref[2.cloud], where the different concepts of cloud computing are introduces, then in section \ref[3.server] the logging server architecture is proposed and finally in section \ref[4.server] the implementation is described.

\seccc Integrate mobile application with logging server

Basics of possible ways of communication are listed in section \ref[2.othercomm] and particular method used in the development is described in section \ref[4.comm].

\seccc Compare your solution with existing solutions

Comparison with the biggest competitor, application Torque, is presented in section \ref[5.ab]. This comparison was done using the A/B tests on a car simulator with users. 

\seccc Evaluate the application using usability testing

Two types of usability tests were performed. A/B tests for the purpose of compare the application CarDashboard with the competitor. Second type of tests, Lane Change Test, was executed on a car simulator as well. Progress and results of usability testing are available in section \ref[5.lct], \ref[5.ab] and in appendix \ref[tests_results].
